In this project, I created three different classes to operate the function of the binary tree.

1 (Binary_Tree_Node class) is a class that is a template container to generate a node for the binary tree to use in the Animal Guessing class.

2 (AnimalGuessing class) a class that create to generate the simple game tree which replicate the "animal" version of the game 20 questions.

3 (BTree class) is a class that is used to create a binary tree with some extra useful functions, such as insert node, search for node, delete, etc.
